# Bouncing Ball Simulation

Welcome to the Bouncing Ball Simulation project! This JavaScript class is designed to create an interactive canvas-based simulation of bouncing balls.

## Overview

The `BouncingBall` class offers a set of functionalities to control and visualize bouncing balls within a canvas. It provides rendering methods, collision detection, and user-driven ball manipulation features.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Simulation:** Renders bouncing balls within the canvas environment, offering an engaging visual experience.
  
- **Interactive Controls:** Enables users to create balls via canvas clicks and adjust ball properties in real-time using dedicated input fields.

- **Collision Detection:** Includes logic to detect collisions between balls and the canvas boundaries, ensuring realistic interaction.

- **Continuous Rendering:** Ensures a seamless animation experience by continuously updating the canvas to reflect ball movements.

### Additional Functionality

- **Parameter Exploration:** Allows experimentation with different ball parameters (e.g., velocity, gravity, elasticity) to understand their effects on ball behavior.


## Usage Instructions

To run the simulation:

1. Clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository).

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser using a live server tool like VSCode's Live Server extension or by running a Python server with `python -m http.server`.

3. Interact with the canvas:
   - Click to create new balls.
   - Modify ball properties using the provided input fields.
